# PixiJS Code Style

PixiJS has a unique taste of coding style, which inspired me to create an ESLint config
that can be installed for any project. This is primarily created for PixiJS plugins built
in Typescript.

## Install

```
npm install -D @pixi/eslint-config
```

## Use

```js
{
    "extends": [
        "@pixi/eslint-config"
    ]
}
```
